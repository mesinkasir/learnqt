	<p>We currently offer our courses both on our Learn Qt Guide (LQG) Platform and Udemy. Udemy allows us to reach a much broader audience we wouldn't even think about otherwise. We're very thankful for that. While helpful though, udemy comes with its own limitations. The big ones for us being able to bundle courses together and offer subscription based payment schemes. We've already had a lot of students ask for that. These two allow us to provide the best possible flexibility to the students. Our offers are listed below.
