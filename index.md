 description: This is probably the most comprehensive course on C++ out there that covers pretty much all of the basic and intermediate features of C++ as well as much of the advanced features out there. I highly recommend this course to anyone who wants a deep dive into C++ and programming in general.

testimonial2:

 description: The course is well-prepared, a valuable resource, and informative. I am looking forward that the instructor will create intermediate and advanced courses for Pyside6. Also, the course was above my expectations and I learned many valuable skills in developing GUI for my Python application.

 description: I have spent years trying to become a programmer / developer based on tutorials and online references. I have made some progress, but there was always this sense that if I had a computer science degree, I would know all the things I do not know. The way Daniel teaches, he teaches you everything, why you should do certain things, and not do other things, even if they are technically possible. Daniel's way of teaching gives me a great deal of confidence.
